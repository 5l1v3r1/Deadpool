Usage

Faulting multiple times the binary requires many disk writes so we'll do it in a tmpfs.  
All steps are performed by ```mount_tmp_and_attack.sh```

Adapt it to your setup if needed. It requires ```deadpool_dfa.py``` from this repository and ```phoenixAES.py``` from [JeanGrey repository](https://github.com/SideChannelMarvels/JeanGrey).

It attacks the 8th round to break the last round key.  

Result is the last round key, so to roll back key scheduling up to initial AES key, one can e.g. use ```aes_keyschedule``` from Stark project.

```bash
aes_keyschedule D6737EF23E86AAF2A1C1F2952B499AA3 10
K00: 474831397B4145532069732046554E7D
```
